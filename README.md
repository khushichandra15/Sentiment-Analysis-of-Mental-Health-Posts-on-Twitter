Project: Sentiment Analysis of Mental Health Posts on Twitter

Overview:
Developed a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system to classify mental health-related tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project explored sentiment trends, visualized patterns, and evaluated multiple classification models for optimal accuracy.

Key Contributions:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Processed and cleaned Twitter dataset (Kaggle) using Pandas.
Removed URLs, mentions, special characters, and irrelevant text to prepare for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed sentiment distributions and word frequencies.
Created bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify sentiment patterns.

Feature Engineering & Model Development:
Applied feature scaling and noise injection for model robustness.
Trained and tested multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN.
Evaluated models using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

Results & Insights:
Identified key sentiment trends in mental health-related discussions on Twitter.
Recommended the most effective classifier based on evaluation metrics.

Tools & Technologies:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Environment: Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:
